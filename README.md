## Strategic Machines

Basic app architecture for the Voice Agents platform

### Features Include
* Data driven AI architecture, where a set of tool descriptors retrieved from the db are used to direct the model for local or remote api calls
* Elegant interactions with the the LIVE Voice Agent, fully instructed through JSON Prompts on the scope, purpose and outcomes of a session
* Speciality tools for retrieving and querying website content, or celebrating a result, or finding and opening a web site
* Visual tool which provides the voice agent with capabilities to render forms, videos, images and documents based on the user request. These forms include a credit card payments for processing Stripe payments, and recording card data in a PCI DSS compliant manner (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) 

See the components/visuals/registry.tsx for the setup of a new component that can be rendered by the tool show_component 

* Tenant Custom tools providing the use case specific tools and functions required by the tenant for activating and enabling their Voice Agent. The Actions collection on Mongo (http descriptors) holds the http tool descriptors, which defines the api calls to the tenant's applications, such as a Booking Engine application (in the case of a tenant Hotel property), buying product (in case of a products company), scheduling appointments (in case of a professional services firm) or providing infomration about events. 

HTTP tool descriptors have declarative UI instructions.
Runtime behavior (from /api/tools/execute):
- Templating context is { args, response, status, secrets }.
- Strings in url/headers/body/ui are templated via `tpl()` (supports filters).
- Success = http.okField exists (truthy) in response OR HTTP 2xx when okField omitted.
- Then apply ui.onSuccess or ui.onError; payload is templated again with the same ctx.
- `pruneEmpty: true` strips "", null, {}, [] before sending.
